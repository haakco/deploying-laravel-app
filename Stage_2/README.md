# Stage 2: The different stages to learning how to deploy a Laravel App

## Intro

At this stage, we'll stop setting up the infrastructure manually. We'll also move to create server images for faster setup. For this we'll be using [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

We'll also start making the system more robust to hand a single server falling over.

### Pros

* Very repeatable
* Faster from nothing to fully setup
* Can simply replicate the entire infrastructure for stating.
* Everything documented.

### Cons
* Far more complicated.
* Takes longer initially to set up.
* Require knowledge for far more application and moving pieces.
* Setting up a local dev still not covered and hard to keep in sync.
* Hard to replicate for development.

## Assumptions

1. Php code is in git.
1. You are using PostgreSQL.
1. If not, replace the PostgreSQL step with your DB of choice.
1. You have a server.
1. In this example and future ones, we'll be deploying to [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/179a47e69ec8)
   but the steps should mostly work with any servers.
1. The server is running Ubuntu 20.04
1. You have SSH key pair.
1. Needed to log into your server securely.
1. You have a Domain Name, and you can add entries to point to the server.
1. We'll be using example.com here. Just replace that with your domain of choice.
1. For DNS, I'll be using [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) in these examples.
1. I would recommend using a DNS provider that supports [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and
   [LetsEncrypt](https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/dns-providers-who-easily-integrate-with-lets-encrypt-dns-validation/86438)

## Steps 1: Get tokens

To automate the infrastructure, we'll need to get some API keys for the providers we are using.

In our case, this is for [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) and Digital ocean.

Let grab those now.

### Getting your Cloudflare API keys

To simplify things, we aren't going to entirely create the DNS zone as you should have one from the
previous steps.

Though we are going to generate a token that can, so we have it for future stages.

You may want to lock down the token more than we are doing in the example.

Log into your Cloudflare account.

On the top right, click on the user icon and then click on ```My Profile```.

![CF My Profile](./images/cf_my_profile.png)

On the next page, select the 'Api Tokens' menu option.

![CF Api tokens](./images/cf_api_tokens.png)

Select the ```Edit zone DNS``` ```Use Template``` button.

![CF Edit DNS Template](./images/cf_edist_dns_template.png)

Now select the ```Create Token``` button.

![CF Create Tokens Button](./images/cf_create_token_button.png)

Give your token a name. (Please do this will help quite a bit once you have more than one token)

For permissions add the following.
* Zone->Zone Settings->Edit
* Zone->Zone->Edit
* Zone->DNS->Edit

For zone restrictions, I've set it to all zones though you may want to lock this down to your specific
account or zone.

I've left IP Address filtering blank, but it's also a good idea to do this if you can.

Once done, click ```Continue to Summary```

![CF Continue to Summary](./images/cf_continue_to_summary.png)

![CF Create Tokens](./images/cf_create_token_settings.png)

Now copy the token from the next page.

Save this somewhere safe as you won't be able to get it again.

I recommend using shared team password management. I'm currently using [https://1password.com/](https://1password.com/),
some friends are using [https://lastpass.com/](https://lastpass.com/), but any will work.

I also recommend creating a bash function to set it as an environmental variable.

Using environmental variables makes it simpler to switch between accounts. It also means you less likely to save any sensitive information in your code.

While we are at it will also add one for TF_VAR_cf_api_key for Terraform.

Here is an example of how to do this. Just add the following to your .bashrc or .zshrc.

```shell
setCFLvDepProfile() {  
  export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="MY_TOKEN"
  export TF_VAR_cf_api_key="${CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN}"
}
```

### Getting your DigitalOcean API key

Log onto your Digital ocean account.

Then click the ```Api``` menu near the bottom on the left.

![DO Api Button](./images/do_api_button.png)

Then make sure you are on the ```Tokens/Keys``` tab and click the ```Generate New Token``` button.

![DO Gen New Token Button](./images/do_token_gen_new_token.png)

Clicking should bring up a box where you can give the token a name.

Leave the 'Write' checkbox ticked.

![DO New Token Settings](./images/do_new_token_settings.png)

Once again, save this token somewhere save.

I would also once again create a bash function to set it.

While we are at it will also add one for TF_VAR_do_token for Terraform.

Here is an example.

```shell
setDOLvDepProfile() {  
  export DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN="MY_DO_TOKEN"
  export TF_VAR_do_token="${DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN}"
}
```

To make our lives easier so, we don't have to run both scripts every time.

I would also create a script that set both environmental variables at the same time.

Here is an example.

```shell
setLvDepProfile() {
  setCFLvDepProfile
  setDOLvDepProfile
}
```

## Steps 2: Build base image

Ok, now that we have our tokens, we are going to create a server image.

Creating an image makes it quicker and simpler to start more servers as you don't have to do any installs to start them up.

For this, we are going to the user [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) and the ansible scripts with some small
changes.

All the scripts for this stage can be found here [./infra](./infra).

The Ansible scripts are specifically here. [./infra/ansible](./infra/ansible).

We are going to make two changes.

We will remove the PostgreSQL setup from Ansible, as we will use DigitalOceans DB as a service.

The second is we are going to use the DNS validation and the Cloudflare API to generate certificates.

This way, we don't have the server accessible to generate the certificates.

To do this, we are going to create a file to store the Cloudflare key that we'll read in from the
environmental variable ```CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN```.

The deployment task now contains.

```shell
- name: Creating a file with content
  ansible.builtin.copy:
    dest: "~/.secrets/certbot/cloudflare.ini"
    content: |
      # Cloudflare API token used by Certbot
      dns_cloudflare_api_token = {{ lookup('env', 'CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN') }}

- name: Create letsencrypt certificate
  shell: certbot certonly -n --dns-cloudflare --dns-cloudflare-credentials ~/.secrets/certbot/cloudflare.ini -m {{ letsencrypt_email }} --agree-tos -d {{ domain_name }} -d www.{{ domain_name }}
  args:
    creates: /etc/letsencrypt/live/{{ domain_name }}
```

Now set up your packer config.

I'm not going to go too much into this as it's reasonably straightforward.

Essentially what Packer is doing is spinning up a virtual server on your chosen cloud provider.

It will then run the specified scripts against this sever. In our case, we'll be using our modified Ansible scripts.

Once the Packer run is complete, it will save the resulting image to the provider and return the unique reference for the server.

We'll then copy this to our terraform scripts.

You can find the full packer file [here](./infra/packer/packer-ubuntu2004-do.pkr.hcl).

If you open it, you'll see the following at the top.

```hcl
variable "do_api_token" {
  type = string
  default = "${env("DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN")}"
  sensitive = true
}

variable "cf_api_token" {
  type = string
  default = "${env("CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN")}"
  sensitive = true
}
```

This config allows us to read the required environmental variables for Cloudflare and Digital ocean.

Next, we specify some variable for image size to use, location and the base image.

Using variables makes it simpler to update the scripts in the future.

```hcl
variable "image_name" {
  type = string
  default = "ubuntu-20-04-x64"
}

variable "region_name" {
  type = string
  default = "fra1"
}

variable "size" {
  type = string
  default = "s-1vcpu-1gb"
}
```

We then specify the settings for the image.

```hcl
source "digitalocean" "autogenerated_1" {
  api_token = "${var.do_api_token}"
  image = "${var.image_name}"
  region = "${var.region_name}"
  size = "${var.size}"
  snapshot_name = "lv-example-${var.image_name}-${var.region_name}-${local.timestamp}"
  ssh_username = "root"
}
```

Finally, we go into the build steps, which specify how we want the image to set up.

The most important being the Ansible one.

```hcl
provisioner "ansible" {
  use_proxy               =  false
  roles_path = "../ansible/roles"
  playbook_file = "../ansible/boostrap.yml"
  ansible_env_vars = [
    "CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=${var.cf_api_token}"]
  extra_arguments = [
    "-e",
    "'ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3'"]
}
```

If you are making changes to the Ansible scripts, I would recommend first just manually spinning up a
server and then running the playbook by hand till everything is working correctly.

If you do it via Packer, it has to spin up a clean server every time, and it takes a long time to debug.

So let go over how to run Packer to create our image.

First, make sure you've set your environmental variables for DigitalOcean and Cloudflare.

We then just basically run Packer, passing it the config file.

```shell
setLvDepProfile
packer build packer-ubuntu2004-do.pkr.hcl
```

Once this has completed running, it should print out the name of the new image file.

Looking at the packer config, you will see this line.

```hcl
snapshot_name = "lv-example-${var.image_name}-${var.region_name}-${local.timestamp}"
```

So the image file name should look something like ```lv-example-ubuntu-20-04-x64-fra1-20210428185323```.

If you go to the ```Image``` section of DigitalOcean, you should also see the image sitting there.

![DO Images](./images/do_images.png)

If you do end up building these images often, please remember to clean this up as you are charged a small amount for the storage.

## Steps 2: Terraform

Terraform itself is reasonably simple to use.

You describe and name the item you want it to create.

You can then use this name to refer to generated values to help you set up future items.

As an example, you describe the server you would like to create. You can then use the named server object
to generate DNS names for its IP's.

Also, you can split your Terraform config into different logical blocks by just creating a new file,
and moving the config section over.

Terraform will read in all files in the same directory ending with ```*.tf``` and then work out
which order to run the setup in.

Let's go over setting up a simple system similar to what we have been doing.

I'll be spinning up the database and Redis using the DigitalOcean database as a service more to show you how
to create different pieces. You may want to run your own.

### Variables
For commonly changed setting, we'll be creating variables. Using variables makes it easier to change these in a single
place rather than hunt through all the files to work out where to change them.

Some variables have default values, and some don't.

The general rule I follow is never to have default values for things you never want to be public.

For anything else, always put a default value.

If you then set an environmental variable following the pattern ```TF_VAR_variable_name```.

Setting the environmental variable will also overwrite default values.

If you look at the bash scripts above, they do this for both the DigitalOcean and Cloudflare API tokens.

### DigitalOcean auth

To start, we need to add the settings that allow Terraform to authenticate against the digital ocean.

First, we create the variable for the token.

```hcl
variable "do_token" {}
```

Then we tell Terraform to authenticate against the digital ocean using that variable.

```hcl
provider "digitalocean" {
  token = var.do_token
}
```

### DigitalOcean server
In this example, we will assume you don't have an SSH key set up in DigitalOcean.

So first, we want to add and register your public key.

```hcl
resource "digitalocean_ssh_key" "ssh-key" {
  name = "SSH Key"
  public_key = file("../ansible/roles/deployment/files/deploy_id_ed25519.pub")
}
```

Next, we want to get the ID for the image we created previously.

We do this by doing a data lookup against DigitalOcean. Giving it the name of the image as they unique
key to do the lookup.

```hcl
data "digitalocean_image" "snapshot" {
  name = var.base_web_snapshot_name
}
```

Next, we want to set up some variables.

The size of server we would like to spin up. (https://developers.digitalocean.com/documentation/v2/#sizes)

```hcl
variable server_size {
  default = "s-1vcpu-1gb"
}
```

The region we would like to spin it up in. (https://developers.digitalocean.com/documentation/v2/#regions)

```hcl
variable region {
  default = "fra1"
}
```

We also set up a variable for the number of servers we would like to spin up.

```hcl
variable "server_count" {
  description = "Amount of servers"
  default = 2
}
```

With those set, we can then do the config to spin up the server.

You'll see that we specify a format to use the count number to make sure the names are unique.

```hcl
resource "digitalocean_droplet" "web" {
  name = "srv${format("%02d", count.index)}.${var.dns_domain}"
  size = var.server_size
  image = data.digitalocean_image.snapshot.id
  region = var.region
  ipv6 = true
  ssh_keys = [
    digitalocean_ssh_key.tim-ssh.id
  ]
  count = var.server_count
}
```

That's all you need to spin up a server.

###Database

I'm not going to go too much into the database config as it's significantly more straightforward than the server above.

```hcl
resource "digitalocean_database_cluster" "postgres-cluster" {
  name = var.db_pg_cluster_name
  engine = "pg"
  version = "13"
  size = var.db_size
  region = var.region
  node_count = var.db_pg_node_count
}

resource "digitalocean_database_db" "database-example" {
  cluster_id = digitalocean_database_cluster.postgres-cluster.id
  name = var.db_pg_name
}
```

We add a firewall for the database allowing only the two servers we created to talk to it.

As we have multiple servers, this is a bit more complicated, and we need to use the ```for_each``` that.
Terraform provides.

Usually, the rule would follow this format.

```hcl
rule {
  type  = "ip_addr"
  value = "192.168.1.1"
}
```

So to loop through the servers and create that, we need to do the following.

```hcl
dynamic "rule" {
  for_each = digitalocean_droplet.web
  content {
    type = "droplet"
    value = rule.value["id"]
  }
}
```

So the complete rule config becomes.

```hcl
resource "digitalocean_database_firewall" "block-external-fw" {
  cluster_id = digitalocean_database_cluster.postgres-cluster.id

  dynamic "rule" {
    for_each = digitalocean_droplet.web
    content {
      type = "droplet"
      value = rule.value["id"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Redis

The Redis config is almost identical to the database one and is below.

```hcl
resource "digitalocean_database_cluster" "redis-cluster" {
  name       = var.db_redis_cluster_name
  engine     = "redis"
  version    = "6"
  size       = var.db_size
  region     = var.region
  node_count = var.db_redis_node_count
}

resource "digitalocean_database_firewall" "block-external-fw-redis-pg" {
  cluster_id = digitalocean_database_cluster.redis-cluster.id

  dynamic "rule" {
    for_each = digitalocean_droplet.web
    content {
      type = "droplet"
      value = rule.value["id"]
    }
  }
}
```

### DNS

We just now need to add the DNS entries so that we know how to talk to servers.

As with DigitalOcean, we need to first authenticate against Cloud flare.

```hcl
provider "cloudflare" {
  api_token = var.cf_api_key
}
```

In this example, we're going to assume that you have already set up your DNS on Cloudflare.

So we first need to do the data lookup to get its information.

```hcl
data "cloudflare_zones" "dns-domain" {
  filter {
    name = var.dns_domain
  }
}
```

Next, I like just creating a test entry to make sure that everything is working. This more needed
while setting all the pieces up.

```hcl
resource "cloudflare_record" "A-test-dns-domain" {
  zone_id = lookup(data.cloudflare_zones.dns-domain.zones[0], "id")
  name = "test"
  type = "A"
  ttl = var.dns_ttl
  proxied = "false"
  value = "127.0.0.1"
}
```

Now I want to add entries for each server so that we can get to each separately.

These setting are needed to do updates for your code for now. (We'll automate this in the future).

Here we use the count again but use the number of servers spun up to get that count.

We then also use the index to get the specific information for each server.

We use the count to generate a unique name.

```hcl
resource "cloudflare_record" "A-srv00" {
  zone_id = lookup(data.cloudflare_zones.dns-domain.zones[0], "id")
  name = "srv${format("%02d", count.index)}.${var.dns_domain}"
  type = "A"
  ttl = var.dns_ttl
  value  = element(digitalocean_droplet.web.*.ipv4_address, count.index)
  count  = length(digitalocean_droplet.web.*.ipv4_address)
}
```

Finally, we add both servers to the DNS entries for the naked domain and ```www``` e.g.

* example.com
* www.example.com

We also set these to proxied. That way, if one goes down, Cloudflare should detect it and send all the traffic to the one that is still up.

Using Cloudflare proxy gives us high availability for the servers and some load balancing when they are both up.

```hcl
resource "cloudflare_record" "A" {
  zone_id = lookup(data.cloudflare_zones.dns-domain.zones[0], "id")
  name = "@"
  type = "A"
  proxied = true
  count  = length(digitalocean_droplet.web.*.ipv4_address)
  value  = element(digitalocean_droplet.web.*.ipv4_address, count.index)
}

resource "cloudflare_record" "A-www" {
  zone_id = lookup(data.cloudflare_zones.dns-domain.zones[0], "id")
  name = "www"
  type = "A"
  proxied = true
  count  = length(digitalocean_droplet.web.*.ipv4_address)
  value  = element(digitalocean_droplet.web.*.ipv4_address, count.index)
}
```

### Output

The last bit to add to our Terraform configs is to print out any of the generated information you need.

Examples would be the IP's of the servers or the database credentials.

As we are automatically setting up the DNS, the primary information we need is how to connect to the database
and to Redis.

To make life simple, I've created a template that takes this information and prints it out into a format that you copy into the .env file for Laravel.

```hcl
data "template_file" "env" {
  template = file("./templates/env.tpl")
  vars = {
    db-host = digitalocean_database_cluster.postgres-cluster.private_host
    db-database = digitalocean_database_cluster.postgres-cluster.database
    db-port = digitalocean_database_cluster.postgres-cluster.port
    db-user = digitalocean_database_cluster.postgres-cluster.user
    db-password = digitalocean_database_cluster.postgres-cluster.password

    db-redis-host = digitalocean_database_cluster.redis-cluster.private_host
    db-redis-port = digitalocean_database_cluster.redis-cluster.port
    db-redis-password = digitalocean_database_cluster.redis-cluster.password
  }
}
```

You can look at the ```output.tf``` file to see some other option over [here.](./infra/terraform/output.tf)

### Terraform apply

That's pretty much it for the Terraform side.

Remember to run the scripts to set the required environment variables. Once that is done, we can then apply
the plan.

```shell
cd Stage_2/infra/terraform
setLvDepProfile
terraform apply
```

The config should print out the changes it will make and prompt you to accept.

Once finished running, it will print out the environmental variables you will need to add to your Laravel
.env to be able to connect to the database and the Redis.

It should look something like this.

```shell
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=private-pg-example-do-user-109433-0.b.db.ondigitalocean.com
DB_PORT=25060
DB_DATABASE=defaultdb
DB_USERNAME=doadmin
DB_PASSWORD=oie3hv6bgyn2ubtn

REDIS_HOST=private-redis-example-do-user-109433-0.b.db.ondigitalocean.com
REDIS_PASSWORD=25061
REDIS_PORT=qvkpta852dzgkzi9
```

Copy this into the ```Stage_2/infra/ansible/roles/deployment/templates/laravel_env.j2``` file.

Once you have done that, go to the Ansible [directory](./infra/Ansible). Update the ```hosts.ini```
to add any missing servers.

Then run the following script.

```shell
ansible-playbook --private-key ./roles/deployment/files/deploy_id_ed25519 -i ./hosts.ini ./deployment.yml
```

The run should update the Laravel code and run the migration and seed.

Your site should now be up :).
